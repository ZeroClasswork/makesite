    <p></p>
<p>Moving along… Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Ow, my spirit! This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!</p>
<p></p>
<p>What are their names? __I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.__ *In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up!* Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ow, my spirit!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Well, then good news! It's a suppository. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. You're going to do his laundry?</p>
<p>2. Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.</p>
<p>3. I don't want to be rescued.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?</p>
<p></p>
<p>There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?</p>
<p></p>
<p>* We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!</p>
<p>* Soothe us with sweet lies.</p>
<p>* Yeah, lots of people did.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Who am I making this out to? Is the Space Pope reptilian!? When will that be? We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Can we have Bender Burgers again?</p>
<p></p>
<p>In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anyone who laughs is a communist! Bender?! You stole the atom. It doesn't look so shiny to me. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. No! Don't jump! I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?</p>
<p></p>
<p>You don't know how to do any of those. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>No, I'm Santa Claus! That's not soon enough! Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bender, quit destroying the universe! Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… OK, if everyone's finished being stupid.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. No, she'll probably make me do it. Can we have Bender Burgers again? Kids have names? And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! It's a T. It goes "tuh". Shut up and get to the point!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! I'm a thing. You lived before you met me?! Then we'll go with that data file! Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.</p>
